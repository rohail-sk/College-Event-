A web application to manage all college events, where:

    Students can register/view events

    Faculty can approve/host events

    Admin controls everything

👥 User Roles
Role	Capabilities
Admin	Add/edit/delete events, approve faculty proposals, view reports
Faculty	Propose events, approve student participation
Student	Browse events, register, view participation
🔑 Core Features by Module
✅ 1. Authentication & Role Management

    Secure login for 3 roles

    JWT with Spring Security

    User dashboard per role

📅 2. Event Module

    Create event (name, date, venue, type, description)

    Edit/delete events (admin/faculty)

    Attach poster, PDF rules

📝 3. Event Registration

    Student can register (with name, roll number, department)

    Prevent duplicate registration

    Max capacity enforcement

🧾 4. Approval Workflow

    Faculty proposes an event

    Admin reviews and approves/rejects

🧮 5. Reports & Analytics (Admin)

    No. of participants per event

    Department-wise engagement

    Export as PDF/CSV

🔔 6. Notifications/Notices

    Event reminder emails or dashboard popups

🧾 7. QR Code for Check-in (Optional Advanced)

    Generate QR for each student

    Scan at event entry (using mobile)

🌟 What Makes It Impressive

    Realistic project colleges can actually use

    Role-based access (admin/faculty/student)

    Clean API design

    Nice visuals (cards/tables for events)

    Optional upgrades: QR check-in, certificate generation, email reminders

✅ Next Steps

Would you like me to:

    Design the ER Diagram?

    Share API endpoints?

    Build the backend module structure?

    Help with the React UI structure?

Let me know where you'd like to begin, and we’ll build it step-by-step.

okay so create a detailed road map i won't be using Spring security

Perfect, Rohail! Here's your detailed roadmap to build a College Event Management System using Spring Boot (without Spring Security) and React.js.
📌 PROJECT ROADMAP

    Tech Stack:

    Frontend: React.js + Bootstrap/Tailwind

    Backend: Spring Boot (no Spring Security)

    Database: MySQL

    Others: Axios (API calls), Postman (testing), iText (PDF), zxing (QR, optional)

✅ PHASE 1: PLANNING & DESIGN
1. Define User Roles:

    Admin – Manages users and events

    Faculty – Proposes events, views participants

    Student – Views/registers for events

2. Design Modules:

    Authentication (manual role management)

    Event Creation + Management

    Registration Handling

    Event Proposal Workflow

    Event Listing & Filtering

    Reporting (CSV/PDF)

    Optional: QR Attendance

3. Prepare ER Diagram / Database Schema:
Suggested Tables:

users(id, name, email, password, role) 
events(id, title, date, venue, description, status, created_by)
registrations(id, event_id, user_id, timestamp)
event_proposals(id, title, description, faculty_id, status)
notices(id, content, created_by, date)

✅ PHASE 2: BACKEND SETUP (Spring Boot)
1. Project Initialization

    Use Spring Initializr

        Dependencies: Web, JPA, MySQL Driver, Lombok

2. Configure application.properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/event_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
server.port=8080

3. Create Layers

    model (Entities)

    repository (JPA Repositories)

    service (Business logic)

    controller (REST APIs)

4. API Endpoints Sample
Operation	Endpoint	Method
Register user	/api/users	POST
Login check (manual)	/api/login	POST
Create event	/api/events	POST
Get events	/api/events	GET
Register for event	/api/events/{id}/register	POST
Submit proposal	/api/proposals	POST
Approve proposal	/api/proposals/{id}/approve	PUT

    🔐 You’ll handle "role access" manually using request body or headers.

✅ PHASE 3: FRONTEND SETUP (React.js)
1. Initialize Project

npx create-react-app college-event-frontend
cd college-event-frontend
npm install axios react-router-dom bootstrap

2. Folder Structure

/src
 ├── components/         // Navbar, Cards, Forms
 ├── pages/              // Home, Login, Dashboard
 ├── services/           // Axios APIs
 ├── context/            // (Optional: Auth context)
 ├── App.js

3. Routing Pages:

    /login

    /dashboard (render different views based on user role)

    /events (browse/register)

    /create-event

    /proposals

    /notices

✅ PHASE 4: FEATURE INTEGRATION
🔁 Login + Role Handling (No Spring Security)

    Simple session management using localStorage (user, role)

    Basic /login API returns user object + role

    Redirect to /dashboard based on role

📅 Event Management (Admin/Faculty)

    Create event form

    Show upcoming/past events

    Edit/delete events (for Admin)

📝 Registration (Student)

    Show events with “Register” button

    Backend stores event_id + user_id in registrations

📤 Event Proposal Workflow

    Faculty submits via form

    Admin sees list of pending proposals and can approve/reject

📈 Reports & Export

    Admin dashboard shows:

        Total registrations per event

        Export CSV (use react-csv)

        Export participant list as PDF (use iText or jspdf)

🧾 Optional Extras

    QR Code for attendance (zxing)

    Email reminders via Spring Mail

    Notification popup for new events

✅ PHASE 5: TESTING & DEPLOYMENT
🧪 Testing

    Use Postman to test all APIs

    Form validations on frontend

🚀 Deployment

    Frontend: Vercel or Netlify

    Backend: Render or Railway

    Use environment variables for production URLs

✅ FINAL TIPS

    Use Lombok for cleaner models

    Create a clean, responsive UI using Bootstrap or Tailwind

    Keep JSON responses consistent

    Use @CrossOrigin("*") in controller during dev
